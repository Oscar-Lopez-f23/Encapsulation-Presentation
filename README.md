# Encapsulation Presentation Plan

- What is encapsulation
	1. Definition: putting state and the behavior operating on that state together in a single unit.
	2. Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal state of an object and exposing only the 
	  necessary functionalities
- Benefits of it / why its important and Software Design Principles:
	1. Security: prevent access to sensitive data
	2. SOLID: follows solid principles, why, and how following SOLID principles can lead to encap
	3. Modularity: reusability, maintainability and testability
	4. abstraction: hides complexity
	5. Cyclomatic complexity
	6. easier refactoring
- IRL examples:
	1. MVC
	2. DDD?
	3. Adapter?
	4. Decorator?
	5. Strategy
- Heuristics && code smells: 
	1. coupling/cohesion
	2. Modules using internal state can be broken down into their own unit
  3. Expose only necessary functionality, 
		prevent unintended access and modification of internal state: HOW?
	4. define contracts; this enforces behaviors
- How to: semi-live code sample
	1. SOLID?
	2. Member Variable Encapsulation
	3. Function Encapsulation
