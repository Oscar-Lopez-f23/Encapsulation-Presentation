Plan
- What is encapsulation
	- Definition: putting state and the behavior operating on that state together in a single unit.
	- Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal state of an object and exposing only the necessary functionalities

- Benefits of it / why its important and Software Design Principles:
	- Pillars: the 4 pillars of OOP enhance development by promoting good practices. They help create flexible, simplified, secure, modular, and reusable code. Together, these principles make development faster, more maintainable, and extensible, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective software.
	- Modularity: 
			- reusability: Since each unit is designed to perform a specific task, it can be easily integrated into other parts of the program without requiring significant modifications. This reduces the need to write new code for common functionalities.
			- maintainability: easier to update and fix, as changes can be made to individual modules without affecting the broader system.
			- testability: Since logic operating on state is isolated more specific tasks can be tested. This makes it easier to identify and fix defects within specific modules.
			- readability: Encapsulation breaks down complex functionality into smaller, more manageable pieces. Each module has a clear and specific purpose, which makes it easier for developers to understand what the code does. Well-defined interfaces between modules also improve comprehension by clearly showing how different parts of the system interact.
	- abstraction: 
			- Hides complexity: code is smaller and hides unnecessary details therefore easier to read and manage
			- Data hiding: Focuses specifically on restricting access to the internal state of an object.
	- defensive:
			- easier refactoring: modules are smaller and focus on specific tasks, meaning refactoring typically involves changes only within the module without affecting the broader system.
			- Separation of Concerns: SoC is achieved by encapsulating information inside a unit of code that has a well-defined interface which leads to a clearer and more organized system structure. This protects aspects or "concerns" within the application model
			- Security: prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data, ensuring that only designated methods can modify it. This isolation not only enhances security but also allows for fewer, more robust unit tests focused on the encapsulated logic. By encapsulating logic and data we are also stopping unsafe actions to be done.
			- Controlled Access: Encapsulation allows controlled access to the object's data. This control is enforced through methods that validate or restrict how the data can be modified.
			- Cyclomatic complexity: program is easier to understand, cuts down the ammount of decisions made in a method/class (The precise number to use as a limit, however, remains somewhat controversial. The original limit of 10 as proposed by McCabe has significant supporting evidence, but limits as high as 15 have been used successfully as well. Limits over 10 should be reserved for projects that have several operational advantages over typical projects, for example experienced staff, formal design, a modern programming language, structured programming, code walkthroughs, and a comprehensive test plan. In other words, an organization can pick a complexity limit greater than 10, but only if it is sure it knows what it is doing and is willing to devote the additional testing effort required by more complex modules.")

- Misc: 
	- web apps vs mobile/desktop: explain how state management is not as demanding in web apps compared to mobile/desktop
	- GOF: Favor Composition over inheritance. Program to Interfaces, not implementations. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact - Head first design patterns

- IRL examples:
	- SRP: SRP leads to more isolated, understandable, and maintainable code by ensuring that each class is focused on a single aspect of the systemâ€™s functionality
	- CQS: command query sepparation states that every method should either be a command that performs an action or a query that returns data to the caller, but not both. commands modify state but does not return value while query is the opposite. There is CQRS but that focuses on separating these actions which is why i wont cover it for encapsulation. An easy example of CQS is the default get;set;
	- behavioral patterns: design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication.
		- Strategy: hides details of the implementation
		- Specification: a specification is an encapsulation of logic in a reusable form,
		- Command pattern: design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time
	- structural patterns : design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities. Patterns like Adapter, Facade, and Mediator are specifically designed to improve encapsulation by providing a simplified interface to complex subsystems.

- coupling/cohesion: 
		- coupling in programming refers to how classes are connected. 
		- cohesion is the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together in other words how closely related and focused the responsibilities are

		We want low coupling so that classes are not too dependant on others as a change to one class can cause a number of changes to another, and high cohesion so we have all related code in one place. Anything that resembles some sort of God class, or a class that does more than one of the things below is not cohesive:
			- Access data located on a disk, database or network
			- Deserialises the data to an object
			- Displays the data to the user
			- Gets an input from the user to perform an operation on the data
			- Persists the changes back to the data

- composition and aggregation (WITH EXAMPLES) : aggregation and composition are the main ways of implementing an encapsulating class. 
		- Aggregation:
			- Aggregation represents a "has-a" relationship where the contained class can exist independently of the whole.
			- It promotes loose coupling because the lifecycle of the contained class is not dependent on the lifecycle of the whole class.

		- Composition:
			- Composition represents a "part-of" relationship where the contained class can only exist as part of the whole.
			- While it doesn't promote loose coupling, composition is ideal for highly cohesive classes where the parts and the whole are tightly bound and work together as a single unit.

		Example to use: Order has a shopping cart (composition) -> shopping cart is made of products (aggregation)

- Heuristics: 
	- look for left right code: if you find variables being modified it might be a sign that the data edited can be encapsulated, some signs include
		- CRY (Continuesly repeting yourself) code (can be multiple instances of a variable being modified)
		- different/multiple responsibilities from containing class/method
		- creation of new instances
		- high cyclomatic complexity
	- heap vs stack: if a value is passed by reference from another module we are editing another classes internal state. Everything in c# is actually passed by value but classes are reference types so their reference is passed by value, but variables passed with the ref or out keyword are passed by reference. b/c the classes reference is passed by value its properties are vulnerable to changes if not readonly but if the receiving method assings the object parameter to a new instance, the original instance passed in from the caller wont be modified.
	- Kerievsky's Encapsulate Subclasses with Creation Methods: hide implementation details
	- class, variable and function encap: set any 
	- Data hiding: Ensures data integrity and prevents unauthorized access and modification. Expose only necessary functionality, prevent unintended access and modification of internal state. Achieved through access control like private, protected, and public specifiers.
	- Modules using internal state can be broken down into their own unit
	- Check for classes that have access to state outside of its own, Ask why and if its necessary
	- Design by contract: define clear and minimal contracts; this enforces behaviors like only exposing what needs to be exposed and prevents clients from being forced to depend on methods they do not use that can most likely modify data when it should not (Interface segregation)
	- encapsulate what varies: Identify and encapsulate aspects of your code that are likely to change. some example include business logic, I/O opperations, settings, customization, configuration, complex algorithms and areas of high coupling
	- keep classes and methods short
	- document code and create good naming conventions

- Heuristics Examples:
	- left right code: payment processor has a method called ProcessOrder where it has a total variable and it keeps modifying it with different private methods withing the class, first total = CalculateTotal(order), then total = ApplyCoupons(order.CouponsArr), then total = ApplyStateTaxes(order)
	- coupling: 2 classes, ShoppingCart and PaymentProcessor, if the Payment Processor class depends on shopping cart any changes done to shopping cart might mean that Payment Processor needs to change as well so we introduce a contract that payment processor can use instead of shopping cart. shopping cart can implement it so that the paymnet processor does not care who the consumer is as long as they follow the contracts rules.
	- cohesion: our payment processor shouldn't be responsible for saving the data to the database as it already has run operations on the shopping cart data to pay for the order. this job should be part of a repository who's contract is injected to the payment processor keeping coupling low
	- ref types: avoid using ref/out keyword and if passing a class make its properties readonly.
	- Kerievsky encapsulate subclasses: show kerievskys example in refactoring to patterns page 15
	- cfv encap: anything that should be only accessible within the class should be private, as an example using Kerievsky's pattern where the base class is public but all implementations can be private and only accessible to the base class, as for variables and methods this is pretty easy just set them as private and should only be accessed by other code within the same class
	- data hiding: 
	- Design by contract: a class like payment processor that inherits from an interface whihc only has one method defined like ProccessPayment() but the implementation has multiple public methods and variables which are not accessible b/c of the contract (not that having them public is a good practice)
	- Document code: use wiki in ADO to explain processes and conventions the team is using (ex: all classes that track creation/update date must inherit from a specific interface so that an automated process updates those during data changes). Code can have comments specifying the purpose of classes, methods and variables.
		Just b/c code is understandable does not mean its purpose is clear especially in business logic.
	- good naming conventions are a form of documentation and help identify design violations for example a class named JsonParserAndValidator which describes multiple responsibilities and violating SRP
